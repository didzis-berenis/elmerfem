# TemperateIce Solver
## General Information
- **Solver Fortran File:** TemperateIce.f90
- **Solver Name:** TemperateIceSolver
- **Required Output Variable(s):** Temp (user defined)
- **Required Input Variable(s):** A Flow Solution (in Flow Solution Name)
- **Optional Output Variable(s):** Temp Homologous, Temp Residual
- **Optional Input Variable(s):** Deformational Heat W

## General Description
This solver treats the heat transfer problem with respect to an upper limit of the temperature (usually with ice the pressure-melting point, T< T_pm). Optionally, such a limit (and furthermore also a lower limit, e.g., T > 0 K) is introduced by solving the consequent variational inequality problem using an algorithm that - in comparison to the free surface problem - can be interpreted as a contact problem solver. In case of temperature, it basically introduces additional heat sinks/sources in order to comply with the constraints.

The volumetric heat source term can be estimated from the ice flow deformational heat using the [DeformationalHeat](./DeformationalHeat.md) Solver.

**Looping option, added 6th June 2013 (version 6205):** It is possible in some cases that the nonlinear convergence tolerance can be reached before all nodes have been properly constrained. At this point the solver can exit with some nodes retaining temperatures above the upper limit. A new option was added to check for nodes with temperatures above the limit and to continue looping if such nodes exist. Using this option may cause more iterations but should ensure the upper limit is properly applied at all nodes. To use it add the following line to the temperate ice solver section in the sif file (default is False):

`Loop While Unconstrained Nodes = Logical True`

## Known bugs
timestep was not initialized; caused excessive heating if transient simulations with more than one iteration at the steady state level were done. Fixed June 2012
