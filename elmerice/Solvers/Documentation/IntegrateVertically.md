# IntegrateVertically Solver
## General Information
- **Solver Fortran File:** IntegrateVertically.f90
- **Solver Name:** IntegrateVertically
- **Required Output Variable(s):** given by the variable name
- **Required Input Variable(s):** Name of the variable to be integrated in Integrated Variable Name, Depth or Height
- **Optional Output Variable(s):** None
- **Optional Input Variable(s):** None

## General Description
This solver compute the depth integrated value of a variable (sum_zb^zs D dz) or the mean value (1/H sum_zb^zs D dz). The resulting integrated value or mean can be computed on the upper surface or on the lower one. If the mean value is computed (Compute Mean = Logical True), the depth (if On Surface = Logical False) or the height (if On Surface = Logical True) has to be calculated. If the integrated variable is calculated on the upper surface (On Surface = Logical True), a Dirichlet BC has to be given at the bottom surface, and vice versa.
