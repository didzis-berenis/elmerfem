# Enthalpy Solver
## General Information
- **Solver Fortran File:** EnthalpySolver.f90
- **Solver Name:** EnthalpySolver
- **Required Output Variable(s):** Enthalpy_h, Phase Change Enthalpy, Temperature and Water Content
- **Required Input Variable(s):** a velocity field
- **Optional Output Variable(s):** None
- **Optional Input Variable(s):** None

## General Description
Solves the enthalpy equation:

*rho {{\partial H}/{\partial t}} + rho u .grad H = div(k grad H) + tr (sigma epsilon) + Q_lat*

where

- *H* is the enthalpy variable
- *rho* is the ice density
- *u* is the ice velocity vector
- *k* is the enthalpy diffusivity
- *tr (sigma epsilon)* the strain heating
- *Q_lat* a complementary source term accounting for melt water refreezing
Enthalpy is defined as a function of the water content omega and the temperature T, such that:

*If H < H_f, then H(T, omega) = int_T0^T C_p (T) dT*

*If H > H_f, then H(T, omega) = int_T0^Tm C_p (T) dT + omega L*

where

- *H_f* is the enthalpy of fusion, defined from the fusion temperature according to the pressure dependent Clausius-Clapeyron relationship.
- *C_p* is the temperature dependant heat capacity, defined as C_p = AT+B
- *L* is the latent heat of fusion
For the boundary conditions, a flux (Enthalpy Heat Flux) has the same meaning than for the temperature solver (W/m2). For a Dirichlet boundary condition on the enthalpy variable, the same definition as in the solver has to be used, i.e. H(T, omega) = int_T0^T C_p (T) dT. See example below.
