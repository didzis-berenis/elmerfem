# Efficient drainage system solver
## General Information
- **Solver Fortran File:** EPLSolver.f90
- **Solver Name:** EPLSolver
- **Required Output Variable(s):** EPLHead, Open EPL and EPLHead Homologous
- **Required Input Variable(s):** IDSHead Residual and IDSHead
- **Optional Output Variable(s):** None
- **Optional Input Variable(s):** EPL Head Upper Limit (required if the upper limit is used)

## General Description
This solver treat the diffusion equation for the efficient drainage system. The activation of the layer is dealt by the Open EPL mask. The upper limit is needed to increase the size of the drainage system once the water head in the efficient layer reaches a given value.

## SIF contents
The required keywords in the SIF file for this solver are given below. The [IDSSolver](./HydrologyIDS.md) is needed to use the efficient layer solver. In the following, we assume that the SIF file is written as shown in the [IDSSolver](./HydrologyIDS.md) section; the SIF should then be written as follows.

```
! Initial condition for the hydrology
Initial Condition 2
  EPLHead = real 0.0
End
```
The transfer between the two layers is dealt with here. An example is given here with the [WaterTransfer](../../UserFunctions/Documentation/WaterTransfer.md) user function, but one could choose to define an other type of transfer (just keep in mind the sign of the transfer, positive if the flux is from the efficient to the inefficient system).

The boundary condition of the hydrological model should be applied on a 1D boundary located at the corner between the side and bed of the mesh.

```
Boundary Condition 4
  Name = "Lower frame"
  Target Boundaries = 4
  
! Flux condition on the borders of the hydrological domain
! Zero flux is not a necessary input as it is the natural 
! boundary condition of the system

  EPLHead Flux BC = Logical True 
  EPLHead Water Flux = Real 0.0
End

Boundary Condition 5
  Name = "Glacier snout"
  Target Boundaries = 5
  
! Take care to choose a value bellow or equals to the upper 
1 limit of the water head
  
  EPLHead = variable coordinate 3, depth
