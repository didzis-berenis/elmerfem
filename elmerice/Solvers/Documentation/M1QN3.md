## Note about Continuous/Discrete Gradients
It is recommended to use the 'Mesh Independent = Logical True' keyword, as this accounts for the variable 'footprint' (i.e. element area) of different nodes on the base of the mesh. This issue becomes particularly noticeable when there is a large variation in mesh resolution across the domain. In such cases, without 'Mesh Independent = Logical True', M1QN3 will tend to alter Beta values only in regions where elements are large (as these make the largest contribution to the discrete cost gradient).
