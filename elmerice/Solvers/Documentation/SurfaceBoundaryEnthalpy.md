## General Description
SurfEnthBoundarySolver is a pseudo-solver which compute surface mass balance and Dirichlet surface boundary condition for the Enthalpy solver. It takes into account firn heating processes by solving vertical melt-water percolation and refreezing.

The solver uses the provided air temperature (and precipitation) daily record to compute the associated mean surface characteristic of the glacier over the period covered by the provided data time series. It can output the following variables:

- Mass Balance (m w.eq./yr): Mean surface mass balance
- Surf Enth (J/kg) : Enthalpy value bellow active layer. Can be use as a Dirichlet condition in the Enthalpy Solver
- Densi (kg/m3): Density field in 3D
- Firn (m w. eq.) : Firn thickness
- Melting (m w.eq./yr) : Surface melting
- Refreeze (m w.eq./yr) : Amount of refreezing (superimposed ice)
- Accu (m w.eq./yr) : Snow accumulation
- Rad_fact (m w.eq./(W/m2)) : Melting factor for radiation
- Rain (m w.eq./yr) : Amount of rain
- PotRad (W/m2) : Potential solar radiation
The mass balance model is based on a degree day model that takes into account potential solar radiation. Mean Enthalpy at 10m-depth (below active layer), is computed by solving the heat equation on a 1D vertical profile forced by a mean annual cycle of air temperature and precipitation determined from the data. This is done for each surface node using a Crank-Nicholson scheme on a 6 cm-resolution grid at a daily time-step. It takes into account the seasonal change of the density profile and allows percolation of water only where density is lower than 800 kg/m3. More details about the model can be found in:

The solver needs output from the FlowDepth Solver :

```
Solver 1

  Equation = "Flowdepth"
   Procedure = File "ElmerIceSolvers" "FlowDepthSolver"
   Variable = String "Depth"
   Variable DOFs = 1
   Linear System Solver = "Direct"
   ! this sets the direction
   ! -1 is negative z-direction (upside down)
   ! +1 is positive (downside up)
   Gradient = Real -1.0E00
   Calc Free Surface = Logical True
   Freesurf Name = String "Surf"
End
```
The solver is called with the following:

```
