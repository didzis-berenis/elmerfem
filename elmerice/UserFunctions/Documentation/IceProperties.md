# User Function IceProperties
## General Information
- **USF Fortran File:** USF_IceProperties.f90
- **USF Name:** IceConductivity, IceCapacity and IcePressureMeltingPoint
- **Required Input Variable(s):** Temperature (IceConductivity, IceCapacity), Pressure (IcePressureMeltingPoint)

## General Description
The aim of these user functions is to provide a Fortran version of the else-as-MATC-functions-prescribed material parameters for ice (except for viscosity, which is handled by Glen's flow law). Fortran functions are way faster in execution time, which, in a run that repeatedly calls those parameters, can lead to tremendous speed-ups. Hence, if computing thermo-mechanically coupled problems, rather stick to this USF.

All input is expected to be in SI units (Temperature in Kelvin). All outputs by default are in SI units, except the user provides scaling factors (see below).

### IceConductivity
The heat conductivity of ice as a function of temperature (T) is defined (in SI units) as:
*\kappa_{ice} = 9.828 . exp(-5.7^{-3} . T) [W m^{−1} K^{−1}]*
### IceCapacity
The capacity of ice as a function of temperature (T) is defined (in SI units) as:
*c = 146.3 + (7.253 . T) [J kg^{−1} K^{−1}]*
### IcePressureMeltingPoint
The pressure melting point of ice as a function of pressure (p) is defined as (in Kelvin):
*T_{pmp} = 273.15 - C_{cc} . max(p, 0) [K]*
where *C_{cc}* is the Clausius Clapeyron constant. In case of negative ice pressures (actually, any below atmospheric pressures), the function uses the reference value at atmospheric pressure.
