# User Function Budd Sliding Relation
## General Information
- **USF Fortran File:** USF_Sliding.f90
- **USF Name:** Sliding_Budd
- **Required Input Variable(s):** Vertical coord, z

## General Description
This is a summary description. See comments in the code module for a more complete description.

Basal shear stress is given by:

*tau_b = C.{u_b}^{m - 1} . u_b . Zab^{q}*
where *Zab* is height above bouyancy, *C* is a friction coefficient, and *m* and *q* are exponents.

The parameters to be given (in the bed boundary condition) are:
- Budd Friction Coefficient → *C*
- Budd Velocity Exponent → *m*
- Budd Zab Exponent → *q*
- Budd Linear Velocity → *u_{t0}*
- Budd Floatation
If Budd Floatation is set to true then the height above buoyancy will be based on the floatation condition instead of inferred from the effective pressure (i.e. depth is used instead of normal stress). Default is false.
